## Team Charter

We are here to build a solid project that actually works. We agree to split the work evenly, listen to everyone's ideas, and help each other out when things get stuck. Our goal is to finish with a rover we are proud of and learn good habits that will help us become better engineers.

## Product Mission Statement

Our goal is to prototype a Mars Scout Rover designed to navigate a simulated Martian surface. The system uses a network of custom boards to detect obstacles (like craters or rocks) and automatically adjust speed to avoid collisions, while allowing us to wirelessly steer the rover and view mission data from a laptop base station.
