# Team Accountability and Coordination

For availability, everyone has agreed that they are more or less always available to work on weekends and later on in the day (starting around 7:00PM - 7:30PM).
As for the method we will use to remind everyone of meetings, we will just text in the group chats. If any changes need to be made, we are all adults and will be able to just communicate it and will make adjustments accordinly.

For coordination, we have a group chat on Discord and will likely set one up over text messages to better be able to reach each other.

For accountability, if a team member repeatedly skips out on contributing, we will first begin by trying to remind them to get back on track. If they need help, we can try to help them and catch them up on anything they may have missed that would help them contribute. If that does not work, we will ultimately have to resort to a pink slip.

For conflicts, if the team appears to be divided over doing something or how to do something, we will just go by a majority vote (and possibly followed by a discussion).
