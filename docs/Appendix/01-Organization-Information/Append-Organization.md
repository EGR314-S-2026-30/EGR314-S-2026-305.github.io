## Role Management Process

| **Question** | **Answer** |
| :----------- | :--------- |
| How often will you change project roles? | Roles will rotate every 3 weeks so that everyone gets the chance to be fully involved in different aspects of the project. |
| How will you decide who is assigned to each role? | Roles were assigned based on each member's strengths, interests, and availability during an initial team discussion. |
| How will team members help one another meet their responsibilities? | Team members will communicate through Discord and text to offer assistance, share workload when someone is overwhelmed, and collaborate on tasks that overlap between roles. |
| How will you identify and respond to situations in which the team must adjust roles and responsibilities? | If a team member is struggling or unavailable, the issue will be raised in a team meeting and responsibilities will be redistributed through group discussion and majority vote. |
| How will you track the team activities and milestones? | The project monitor will maintain a Gantt chart and keep everyone updated on deadlines and progress through regular check-ins in the group chat. |
| How will you assign technical responsibilities to the team members? | Technical tasks will be divided based on individual expertise and interest, coordinated by the technical lead to ensure consistency and balanced workload across the team. |

# Team Accountability and Coordination

## Communication Plan

**Methods:** We will use Discord as our primary tool for both asynchronous (chat/updates) and synchronous (voice calls) communication. We will also have a group text chat as a backup for urgent alerts. We are avoiding other apps to keep things simple.

**Instructor Correspondence:** The Team Lead is responsible for emailing the instructor. Any replies will be screenshotted and posted in the Discord "Announcements" channel so the whole team sees the information immediately.

**File Sharing:** We have created a shared Google Drive folder for all project files, reports, and assets, following the required naming conventions.

## Meeting Schedule and Coordination

**Availability:** We identified that everyone is generally available on weekends and weekdays after 7:00 PM.

**Weekly Slot:** Our standing weekly meeting will be Tuesdays at 7:30 PM.

**Format:** These meetings will be virtual (via Discord Voice) to save travel time, but we can meet in person at the lab on weekends if hardware testing is needed.

**Reminders:** We will send a "pinned" mention in the Discord chat 1 hour before the meeting.

**Changes:** Since we are all adults, if a time needs to change, a member must request the change in the group chat at least 24 hours in advance so we can adjust.

## Team Coordination & Accountability

**Submission & Skills:** Before any assignment is submitted, we will post the draft in Discord for a "thumbs up" sign-off from all members. If a member lacks the specific skill for a task (e.g., coding or PCB design), they will pair up with a more experienced member to learn, ensuring no one is left behind.

**Design Reviews:** Feedback received from design reviews will be listed as "Action Items" in our Google Doc, and specific members will be assigned to fix them before the next meeting.

**Addressing Underperformance:**

- **First Miss:** We will reach out to remind them and ask if everything is okay.
- **Support:** If they are struggling, we will schedule a working session to catch them up.
- **Consequences:** If a member repeatedly ignores help, ghosts the team, or fails to contribute after warnings, we will resort to a pink slip to protect the team's grade.

## Conflict Recognition & Resolution

**Disagreements:** We acknowledge that engineering involves different opinions. When we disagree on a design choice, we will discuss the technical pros and cons of each option.

**Resolution:** If we cannot agree after a discussion, we will rely on a majority vote to move forward.

**Role Conflicts:** We will avoid conflicts of interest by clearly sticking to the roles defined in our Charter (e.g., The Actuation Lead makes final calls on motors).

**Escalation:** We will only involve the instructor if a conflict completely halts our progress or if a team member becomes hostile/unprofessional.
