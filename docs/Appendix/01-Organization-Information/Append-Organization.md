## Role Management Process

| **Question** | **Answer** |
| :----------- | :--------- |
| How often will you change project roles? | Roles will rotate every 3 weeks so that everyone gets the chance to be fully involved in different aspects of the project. |
| How will you decide who is assigned to each role? | Roles were assigned based on each member's strengths, interests, and availability during an initial team discussion. |
| How will team members help one another meet their responsibilities? | Team members will communicate through Discord and text to offer assistance, share workload when someone is overwhelmed, and collaborate on tasks that overlap between roles. |
| How will you identify and respond to situations in which the team must adjust roles and responsibilities? | If a team member is struggling or unavailable, the issue will be raised in a team meeting and responsibilities will be redistributed through group discussion and majority vote. |
| How will you track the team activities and milestones? | The project monitor will maintain a Gantt chart and keep everyone updated on deadlines and progress through regular check-ins in the group chat. |
| How will you assign technical responsibilities to the team members? | Technical tasks will be divided based on individual expertise and interest, coordinated by the technical lead to ensure consistency and balanced workload across the team. |

# Team Accountability and Coordination

For availability, everyone has agreed that they are more or less always available to work on weekends and later on in the day (starting around 7:00PM - 7:30PM).
As for the method we will use to remind everyone of meetings, we will just text in the group chats. If any changes need to be made, we are all adults and will be able to just communicate it and will make adjustments accordinly.

For coordination, we have a group chat on Discord and will likely set one up over text messages to better be able to reach each other.

For accountability, if a team member repeatedly skips out on contributing, we will first begin by trying to remind them to get back on track. If they need help, we can try to help them and catch them up on anything they may have missed that would help them contribute. If that does not work, we will ultimately have to resort to a pink slip.

For conflicts, if the team appears to be divided over doing something or how to do something, we will just go by a majority vote (and possibly followed by a discussion).
