title: Concept Generation and Design Ideation
---

## Background Reading and Design Constraints

Key takeaways from the EGR 314 project description and interactive exhibit design readings informed our ideation process. The device must be durable, safe for repeated public use, and intuitive without requiring lengthy instructions. Readings emphasized minimizing cognitive overload, providing immediate feedback, and avoiding hidden interactions that can confuse users.

Brainstorming resources highlighted the importance of deferring judgment, encouraging unconventional ideas, and generating a large quantity of concepts before converging. These principles guided our initial ~100-idea brainstorm and our later sorting and refinement process.

## Goal of the Exploration Device
The goal of this exploration device is to simulate a realistic robotic exploration rover equipped with a robotic sampling arm, representative of systems used in NASA planetary and remote-environment missions. The rover is designed to demonstrate how engineers remotely navigate, sense, manipulate, and collect samples in environments where direct human presence is impossible. The device emphasizes system-level thinking, sensor–actuator integration, and operational decision-making under constraints. Rather than focusing on entertainment or basic instruction, the rover is intended to showcase engineering design considerations such as mobility tradeoffs, arm kinematics, sensing limitations, communication latency, and fault handling. Users interact with the rover as operators and analysts, reinforcing the relationship between system design choices and mission outcomes.

## Intended Audience
The primary audience for this exploration device is students in grades 6–12 and adult learners in informal educational environments such as science museums, engineering outreach events, and university open houses. The device is designed to be accessible to first-time users while remaining engaging for repeat users and older audiences. Its structure supports both individual exploration and small-group collaboration.

Secondary audiences include educators, families, and facilitators who may use the exhibit as a teaching tool or discussion starter. The interface avoids reliance on extensive text and instead uses visual cues, icons, and intuitive physical controls to accommodate a wide range of ages, learning styles, and accessibility needs.
