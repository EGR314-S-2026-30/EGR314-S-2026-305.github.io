title: Concept Generation and Design Ideation

## Background Reading and Design Constraints

From our research we found that a good exploration device needs to be realistic but still easy to understand and use. The person using it should always know what the rover is doing and how their actions affect it. Good feedback through visuals and sounds helps make the system feel natural since operators cant directly touch the rover or see everything its sensing. We also learned that durability and safety are really important. The rover has to handle being used over and over again along with bumps and mistakes without breaking. The moving parts should be protected and the motors should be limited to safe forces. The controls should also go to a safe state if something goes wrong. These are similar to the real challenges engineers deal with when building planetary rovers. Our research also showed that too many controls or hidden features can confuse people. Keeping things simple and giving clear feedback makes it easier for users to understand what is happening and finish tasks. Brainstorming a lot of ideas before picking what to include helped us come up with creative ways to meet these needs.

## Goal of the Exploration Device

The goal of this exploration device is to simulate a realistic planetary rover with a robotic sampling arm that represents real planetary missions. The rover is meant to show how engineers remotely drive around and collect samples in places where humans cant go. It will demonstrate things like how sensors and motors work together and how decisions are made when theres limited information. The rover shows engineering concepts like how different wheel designs affect movement and how the arm moves and what happens when theres communication delay. Users get to actually use the rover and learn how its design affects what it can do.

## Intended Audience

The main audience for this device is NASA engineers and researchers who want to study or test rover systems in realistic situations. Its designed for people who understand remote control and sensor feedback and robot arms. They want to see how the design of the system affects how well it performs missions. A secondary audience is aerospace engineering students and research partners who can use the rover as a hands on learning tool to explore control strategies and sample collection. The interface is designed to be clear and give all the info through lights and sounds so users can focus on testing and learning.

**Concept B: Open Exploration Rover**  
Users freely explore and experiment with the rover without set goals or instructions.  

**Concept C: Collaborative Science Rover**  
Multiple users work together sharing control and discussing data to complete tasks as a team.  

## Product Concept Descriptions and Evaluation

## Concept A: Mission Rover

This concept gives users short missions to complete. They navigate terrain and collect samples and check sensor readings. Visual and audio cues guide them through each step so they always know what to do. We designed it to avoid common problems like having too many controls active at once or hiding features users need.  

![Concept A](https://github.com/EGR314-S-2026-30/EGR314-S-2026-305.github.io/blob/main/docs/Assets/Concept_A.png?raw=true)

### Functional Distribution Across Team Members

- Internet-based two-way wireless communication handles data transmission and logging and system status reporting  
- Human-machine interface covers the touchscreen UI and buttons and visual cues and user feedback  
- Sensor and actuator control manages motors and the robotic arm and sensors and closed-loop responses  
- System integration and safety handles power management and fault detection and durability testing  

### Design Justification

- Cues include LED animations and on-screen arrows and audio feedback and progress indicators  
- Controls use large buttons and a joystick to make operation straightforward  
- Durability and Comfort comes from enclosed mechanisms and current-limited motors and ergonomic layout  
- Instruction uses a brief mission briefing and looping tutorial so no one needs to explain it  

## Concept B: Open Exploration Rover

The Open Exploration Rover concept focuses on letting users discover things on their own by removing set objectives and letting them freely interact with the rover and its environment. Users can navigate terrain and operate sensors and experiment with what the rover can do at their own pace. This approach encourages curiosity and creativity and self-directed learning but it ranked lower overall because theres more risk of user confusion and lack of clear guidance for first-time users. Without structured goals some users might not understand the rovers purpose or how to actually use its systems.  

![Concept B](https://github.com/EGR314-S-2026-30/EGR314-S-2026-305.github.io/blob/main/docs/Assets/Concept_B.png?raw=trueg)

### Functional Distribution Across Team Members

- Internet-based two-way wireless communication handles real-time telemetry streaming and live sensor data visualization and remote command handling  
- Human-machine interface provides an open-ended touchscreen UI and manual control inputs and live data dashboards with minimal instructions  
- Sensor and actuator control gives direct control of motors and robotic arm and cameras and environmental sensors with fewer automated constraints  
- System integration and safety manages power regulation and collision prevention and emergency stop logic and robustness for unpredictable user behavior  

### Design Justification

- Cues are minimal with just raw sensor readouts and subtle status LEDs to avoid over-directing users  
- Controls give full access through joystick and manual controls that expose the rovers complete functionality  
- Durability and Comfort comes from a reinforced chassis and protected actuators and current-limited systems to handle rough use  
- Instruction uses optional on-demand help screens and tooltips instead of guided tutorials to keep a sense of freedom while offering some support  

## Concept C: Collaborative Science Rover

The Collaborative Science Rover concept focuses on teamwork and shared problem-solving by letting multiple users simultaneously control different parts of the rover. Each person is responsible for a specific role like navigation or sensor operation or data analysis which encourages communication and collaboration. While this concept promotes social learning and mirrors how real scientific teams work it adds extra interface and coordination complexity that can be challenging if roles are not clearly defined.

![Concept C](https://github.com/EGR314-S-2026-30/EGR314-S-2026-305.github.io/blob/main/docs/Assets/Concept_C.png?raw=true)

### Functional Distribution Across Team Members

- Internet-based two-way wireless communication handles multi-user session management and synchronized command handling and shared data streams  
- Human-machine interface provides role-based control panels and multi-screen or multi-input support and shared visual feedback  
- Sensor and actuator control partitions control of motors and robotic arm and cameras and sensors to different users  
- System integration and safety manages command arbitration and conflict resolution and system safeguards and fault handling across multiple operators  

### Design Justification

- Cues include role-specific visual indicators and shared status displays and alerts to communicate system state across users  
- Controls are segmented and mapped to user roles to prevent conflicting inputs  
- Durability and Comfort comes from robust mechanical design and software interlocks to protect hardware from simultaneous or conflicting commands  
- Instruction uses brief role introductions and cooperative task prompts to help users understand responsibilities and work together effectively  


## Selected Concept

- We have chosen to select the Mission Rover (Concept A) for our project. 

Quick Summary:

- Concept A is a mission-based rover where users complete simple tasks designed to familiarize them with the rover. This will be achieved by using communication signals such as audio/visual cues.

- We chose Concept A because it gives users clear goals and instructions, which makes the rover easier to understand and use. The mission-based design keeps users engaged with the rover and it ensures that the user gets the hang of how to use the rover.

## Concept Selection Rationale

After comparing all three concepts on usability and educational value and durability and safety and how well they fit exhibit design guidelines the Mission Rover won out. It balances engagement with simplicity better than the others. We pulled in some ideas from the other concepts but the mission-based structure gave us the strongest foundation.


## Final Selected Concept Summary

- Clear indicators through multiple channels like visuals and audio  
- Simple controls that anyone can pick up  
- Built tough and safe for repeated use  
- Minimal instructions needed because the design guides users naturally
