The big takeaways were that the device has to be durable enough for repeated public use, safe for all ages, and easy to figure out without needing a ton of instructions. The readings also talked about not overwhelming users with too much info at once and making sure feedback happens right away so people know what they did.</p> <p>The brainstorming guides we looked at said not to judge ideas too early and to just get as many out there as possible before narrowing down. We followed that approach when we came up with our initial list of about 100 ideas.</p>"},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#goal-of-the-exploration-device","title":"Goal of the Exploration Device","text":"<p>The point of this device is to let users experience what remote scientific exploration feels like. They get to operate a mobile rover with a robotic arm that can pick up samples, kind of like how real exploration missions work when scientists can't physically be there. Think planetary rovers or robots used in hazardous environments.</p> <p>The rover teaches through doing. Users get visual and audio feedback right away when they take actions, which helps them understand cause and effect. They can test out different strategies for driving around and collecting samples, and then see how their choices play out.
