The person using it should always know what the rover is doing and how their actions affect it. Good feedback through visuals and sounds helps make the system feel natural since operators cant directly touch the rover or see everything its sensing. We also learned that durability and safety are really important. The rover has to handle being used over and over again along with bumps and mistakes without breaking. The moving parts should be protected and the motors should be limited to safe forces. The controls should also go to a safe state if something goes wrong. These are similar to the real challenges engineers deal with when building planetary rovers. Our research also showed that too many controls or hidden features can confuse people. Keeping things simple and giving clear feedback makes it easier for users to understand what is happening and finish tasks. Brainstorming a lot of ideas before picking what to include helped us come up with creative ways to meet these needs.</p>"},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#goal-of-the-exploration-device","title":"Goal of the Exploration Device","text":"<p>The goal of this exploration device is to simulate a realistic planetary rover with a robotic sampling arm that represents real planetary missions.
