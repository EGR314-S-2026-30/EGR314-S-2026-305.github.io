The device must be durable, safe for repeated public use, and intuitive without requiring lengthy instructions. Readings emphasized minimizing cognitive overload, providing immediate feedback, and avoiding hidden interactions that can confuse users.</p> <p>Brainstorming resources highlighted the importance of deferring judgment, encouraging unconventional ideas, and generating a large quantity of concepts before converging. These principles guided our initial ~100-idea brainstorm and our later sorting and refinement process.</p>"},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#goal-of-the-exploration-device","title":"Goal of the Exploration Device","text":"<p>The goal of this exploration device is to immerse users in the process of remote scientific exploration by allowing them to operate a mobile rover equipped with a robotic sampling arm. The device simulates real-world exploration scenarios in which direct human interaction is not possible, such as planetary exploration, hazardous material sampling, or environmental monitoring in extreme conditions. Through hands-on interaction, users learn how scientists and engineers gather data, make decisions with limited feedback, and adapt to constraints imposed by remote systems.</p> <p>The rover encourages inquiry-based learning by providing immediate visual, auditory, and sensor-based feedback in response to user actions. Users are prompted to hypothesize outcomes, test strategies for navigation and sampling, and reflect on how design choices impact mission success. The exhibit is designed to balance engagement with clarity, ensuring that the learning objectives are reinforced through interaction rather than overwhelmed by complexity.</p>"},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#intended-audience","title":"Intended Audience","text":"<p>The primary audience for this exploration device is students in grades 6\u201312 and adult learners in informal educational environments such as science museums, engineering outreach events, and university open houses. The device is designed to be accessible to first-time users while remaining engaging for repeat users and older audiences. Its structure supports both individual exploration and small-group collaboration.</p> <p>Secondary audiences include educators, families, and facilitators who may use the exhibit as a teaching tool or discussion starter. The interface avoids reliance on extensive text and instead uses visual cues, icons, and intuitive physical controls to accommodate a wide range of ages, learning styles, and accessibility needs.</p>"},{"location":"02-Concept-Design/Design/#generating-ideas","title":"Generating Ideas","text":"<p>The following list represents an initial, unfiltered brainstorm of approximately 100 potential features, concepts, and design strategies.
