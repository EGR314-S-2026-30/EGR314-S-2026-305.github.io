To ensure everyone has the opportunity to participate fully, roles will rotate every 3 weeks. Team members will help one another meet their responsibilities by communicating through Discord and text to offer assistance and collaborate on tasks that overlap between roles. If a team member is struggling or unavailable, the issue will be raised in a team meeting and responsibilities will be redistributed through group discussion and majority vote.
